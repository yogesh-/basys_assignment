# Software Design Document

## Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a software that would allow admins to register payers and providers on the platform. The platform needs to have secure access controls, data validation and follow compliance.

## Stack:
The software is built using the MERN(Postgres instead of MongoDB) stack:
•	Frontend: ReactJS
•	Backend: Node.js, Express
•	Database: Postgres
•	Styling: Tailwind CSS

## Security:
•	Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt to ensure secure storage and transmission


## Deployment:
During development and testing, PostgresDB from AWS RDS was used for data storage. Both frontend and backend were developed and functionally tested on local machine.
